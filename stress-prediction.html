                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>This project is about creating a smart system that can detect when a person is feeling stressed by
                    using small sensors that measure things like heart rate and skin moisture. These sensors send the
                    information to a tiny computer, which then uses artificial intelligence (AI) to figure out how
                    stressed the person is—whether they are relaxed, a little stressed, or very stressed.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>🎯 Key Innovation</h3>
                <p>This project was published in the International Journal of Innovative Research in Technology (IJIRT),
                    demonstrating its academic significance and technical excellence in the field of IoT-based health
                    monitoring systems.</p>

                <h2>Real-World Impact</h2>
                <p>A real-life example that shows why this project is important is V.G. Siddhartha, the founder of Café
                    Coffee Day. Even though he was a successful businessman, he was going through a lot of stress and
                    pressure, especially related to money and business problems. Sadly, he didn't get the help he needed
                    in time, and this led to a very tragic outcome.</p>
                <p>If a system like the AI-Based Stress Prediction System had been there, it could have warned him early
                    and suggested ways to reduce stress. This shows how important it is to keep an eye on stress and
                    take care of mental health, especially for people dealing with a lot of responsibilities.</p>

                <h2>Results & Validation</h2>
                <p>The system was tested and it worked well. It was able to read heart rate and GSR (skin response) from
                    the sensors. The data was shown live on a web dashboard. When someone was stressed, the system gave
                    an alert. The AI model could tell if the person was calm or stressed.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>📊 Performance Metrics</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Classification Accuracy:</strong> ~90%</li>
                    <li><strong>Sensitivity:</strong> ~88%</li>
